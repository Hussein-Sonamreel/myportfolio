  description: 'A charming and high-performance e-commerce store for a local boutique bakery, focusing on online orders and local delivery.',
  problem: 'The bakery relied on phone calls and social media messages for orders, which was inefficient and prone to errors. They needed a centralized system to showcase their products and manage sales.',
  solution: 'I built a custom e-commerce platform with a user-friendly product catalog, a secure checkout process, and an order management dashboard for the staff. The design was warm, inviting, and on-brand.',
  result: 'Online orders increased by 300% in the first three months, and staff saved an average of 5 hours per week on manual order processing.',
